# Steamed Hams but its a Text-Based Adventure
 Steamed Hams but its a Text-Based Adventure what more can I say?
 Probably some instructions on how to play the game, the parser is very simple so you have to seperate the verb and noun with a colon : or it cant parse the input.
 For a list of commands use Help : Please, and yes you do have to say please.
 If you're still stuck there is a secret hint command, or maybe you could try calling someone for help...
 
 Currently still a WIP in Beta, but it is feature complete. The main steamed hams run where you directly mimic the show is possible, everything else still needs a bit of work but if there is enough interest in the project I'll finish the fire mechanics and add alternate routes and additional rooms.
