  description: There is some kind of strange device here, you are not sure if its
    called The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy or DONT PANIC. Either way you don't
    recognize it.
  examineDescription: Its a small device rather like a largish electronic calculator,with
    about a hundred tiny flat press buttons and a screen about four inches square.
    It seems insanely complicated, however the buttons are all stuck together.
