  description: On the ceiling there is a smoke alarm.
  examineDescription: A faded white smoke alarm, As you examine the smoke alarm in
    the kitchen, you cant help but notice the conspicuous absence of batteries. Its
    almost as if someone deliberately decided to leave them out, perhaps as part
    of an avant-garde artistic statement on the futility of modern safety measures.
    Or perhaps someone simply forgot to buy batteries.
