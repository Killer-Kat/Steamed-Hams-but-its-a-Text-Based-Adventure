  description: There is a strange device here, it has a logo with a knob in the middle
    of the letters, currently the logo spells out Z-Remover.
  examineDescription: 'It is a blunt-nosed plastic device, about the size of a laser
    pointer, that can be waved at things to remove excess Zs. It is not very powerful,
    and often fails against large items. On the other hand, it has a wide range of
    action: it can be set to any letter you choose, at least it could be if the knob
    was not broken.'
